# How to Test the Agent

## Method 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd feedcast-livekit/feedcast-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/agent.py dev
```

**What you'll see if it works:**
- Connection messages to LiveKit Cloud
- "Looking for participants..." logs
- Agent waits for iOS app to connect

**What you'll see if it fails:**
- Import errors
- Connection errors
- API key errors

## Method 2: Console Test (Talk to it in Terminal)
```bash
cd feedcast-livekit/feedcast-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/agent.py console
```

**This lets you:**
- Speak directly to the agent
- Test voice responses
- See if transcript parsing works
- Quick smoke test

## Method 3: Check Cloud Deployment
Visit: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_feedcast-gdavr142

Look for:
- Active agents
- Recent connection logs
- Agent status

## Method 4: Test from iOS App
1. Start the agent with `python src/agent.py dev`
2. Open iOS app
3. Start a voice chat
4. Check both logs:
   - iOS console: Shows metadata being sent
   - Agent logs: Shows metadata being received
