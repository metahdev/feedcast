# Feedcast üéôÔ∏è

An AI-personalized podcast application for iOS that generates custom podcast content daily or on-demand based on user interests.

## üì± Overview

Feedcast is an innovative iOS app built for hackathons that combines AI-generated content with an intuitive podcast listening experience. Users can manage their interests, listen to personalized podcasts, and interact with an AI assistant that understands the podcast context.

### Key Features

- **AI-Generated Podcasts**: Daily personalized podcasts based on user interests
- **On-Demand Generation**: Request custom podcasts for specific topics
- **Integrated Chat**: Ask questions about podcasts while listening
- **Interest Management**: Curate topics that shape your content
- **Beautiful UI**: Inspired by Apple Books and Podcasts apps
- **Smart Playback**: Resume where you left off, adjust speed, skip controls

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern with a clean separation of concerns:

```

## üîß Current Implementation

### Data Layer (Models)

**Podcast & Episode**
- `Podcast`: Represents an AI-generated podcast with metadata, episodes, and interests
- `Episode`: Individual episodes within a podcast with audio URL support

**User & Interests**
- `User`: User profile with preferences and settings
- `Interest`: Topics/categories that personalize content generation
- `PlaybackState`: Resume playback across sessions

**Chat**
- `ChatMessage`: Messages between user and AI
- `Conversation`: Chat history per podcast
- Context-aware responses based on podcast content

### Service Layer

All services are currently using **dummy data** for hackathon prototyping:

**PodcastService** (`Services/PodcastService.swift`)
- Manages podcast library
- Currently returns mock podcasts
- **TODO**: Integrate with backend for real data
- **Future**: Connect to FetchAI for content generation

**ChatService** (`Services/ChatService.swift`)
- Handles chat conversations
- Simple rule-based responses for demo
- **TODO**: Integrate FetchAI for intelligent responses
- **Future**: Add streaming responses for better UX

**UserService** (`Services/UserService.swift`)
- Manages user profile and interests
- Local storage only
- **TODO**: Integrate Supabase Auth
- **Future**: Add iCloud sync for cross-device

### ViewModels

**LibraryViewModel**
- Manages podcast library state
- Filtering, sorting, and search
- Podcast generation requests

**PlayerViewModel**
- Playback controls and state
- Simulated audio playback (timer-based)
- Integrated chat functionality
- **TODO**: Replace with LiveKit audio streaming

**InterestsViewModel**

## üîå Integration Points for Future Development

### 1. LiveKit Integration (Audio Streaming)

**File**: `ViewModels/PlayerViewModel.swift`

```swift
// TODO: Replace simulated playback with LiveKit
func startPlayback() {
    // Initialize LiveKit room
    // Connect to audio stream
    // Handle playback events
}
```

**Key Integration Areas:**
- Real-time audio streaming
- Low-latency playback
- Background audio support
- Network resilience

### 2. FetchAI Integration (Content Generation)

**File**: `Services/PodcastService.swift`

```swift
// TODO: Integrate FetchAI for podcast generation
func generatePodcast(interests: [Interest], prompt: String?) async throws -> Podcast {
    // 1. Send user interests to FetchAI agent
    // 2. Receive structured podcast content
    // 3. Parse and create Podcast model
    // 4. Return generated podcast
}
```

**File**: `Services/ChatService.swift`

```swift
// TODO: Integrate FetchAI for intelligent chat
func sendMessage(...) async throws -> ChatMessage {
    // 1. Send message with podcast context to FetchAI
    // 2. Stream or receive AI response
    // 3. Create and return ChatMessage
}
```

**Key Integration Areas:**
- Daily podcast content generation
- On-demand topic-based generation
- Context-aware chat responses
- Transcript analysis for better answers

### 3. Supabase Backend Integration

**Authentication** (`Services/UserService.swift`)
```swift
// TODO: Add Supabase Auth
func signIn(email: String, password: String) async throws -> User
func signUp(email: String, password: String) async throws -> User
func signOut() async throws
```

**Database Schema Recommendations:**

```sql

## ü§ñ AI Integration Details

### FetchAI Integration Strategy

**Podcast Generation Workflow:**
1. User interests are sent to FetchAI agent
2. Agent queries relevant news, articles, and data sources
3. Content is structured into podcast script format
4. Text-to-speech conversion (potential: ElevenLabs integration)
5. Audio returned and stored via LiveKit

**Chat Interaction Workflow:**
1. User message sent with podcast context (transcript, metadata)
2. FetchAI agent analyzes context and user query
3. Intelligent response generated based on content
4. Streaming response for better UX
5. Conversation history maintained for context

### LiveKit Integration Strategy

**Audio Streaming Setup:**
- Create LiveKit room per podcast generation session
- Stream audio in real-time as it's generated
- Support pause/resume with buffering
- Handle network interruptions gracefully

**Recommended Configuration:**
```swift
// Example LiveKit setup
let room = Room()
room.connect(url: liveKitURL, token: accessToken)

// Subscribe to audio tracks
room.onTrackSubscribed = { track, publication, participant in
    if let audioTrack = track as? RemoteAudioTrack {
        // Play audio track
    }
}
```

### Context for Future Development

**For adding new features:**
1. Models go in `feedcast/Models/`
2. Business logic in `feedcast/Services/`
3. State management in `feedcast/ViewModels/`
4. UI in `feedcast/Views/`

**For backend integration:**
- All services have clear TODO comments
- Service methods use async/await pattern
- Error handling is implemented
- Mock data can be easily replaced

**For AI integration:**
- See integration points section above
- Services are ready for async API calls
- Models support all necessary fields

**Key Design Patterns:**
- MVVM architecture throughout
- Combine for reactive programming
- SwiftUI for declarative UI
- Async/await for asynchronous operations

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a hackathon project. For team members:
