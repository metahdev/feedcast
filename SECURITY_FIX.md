# Security Fix: User-Specific Podcast Filtering

## Issue
The app was loading ALL podcasts from the database regardless of which user was logged in. This is a critical security and privacy issue because:
- Users could potentially see other users' podcasts
- Database was returning unnecessary data
- Performance impact from loading too much data
- Privacy violation

## Solution
Added user-specific filtering to all podcast database queries using the current user's ID.

## Changes Made

### 1. `fetchPodcasts()` Method
**Before:**
```swift
let podcastsData: [PodcastResponse] = try await supabase
    .from("podcasts")
    .select()
    .order("created_at", ascending: false)
    .execute()
    .value
```

**After:**
```swift
guard let userId = UserService.shared.currentUser?.id else {
    throw NSError(domain: "PodcastService", code: 401, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "User not authenticated"])
}

let podcastsData: [PodcastResponse] = try await supabase
    .from("podcasts")
    .select()
    .eq("user_id", value: userId)  // ← Added filter
    .order("created_at", ascending: false)
    .execute()
    .value
```

### 2. `deletePodcast()` Method
**Before:**
```swift
try await supabase
    .from("podcasts")
    .delete()
    .eq("id", value: id)
    .execute()
```

**After:**
```swift
guard let userId = UserService.shared.currentUser?.id else {
    throw NSError(domain: "PodcastService", code: 401, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "User not authenticated"])
}

try await supabase
    .from("podcasts")
    .delete()
    .eq("id", value: id)
    .eq("user_id", value: userId)  // ← Added filter
    .execute()
```

## Security Improvements

### ✅ Data Isolation
- Each user now only sees their own podcasts
- No data leakage between users
- Proper multi-user support

### ✅ Authorization Check
- Users can only delete their own podcasts
- Prevents malicious deletion of other users' content
- Added authentication checks before operations

### ✅ Performance
- Queries return only relevant data
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Faster load times for users with fewer podcasts

### ✅ Error Handling
- Added proper authentication error responses
- Clear error messages when user is not authenticated
- Returns 401 status code for unauthenticated requests

## Database Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
This fix provides **application-level security**. For defense-in-depth, you should also enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on podcasts table
ALTER TABLE podcasts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can only see their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only insert their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only update their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can only delete their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own podcasts"
ON podcasts FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Same for episodes table
ALTER TABLE episodes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own episodes"
ON episodes FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM podcasts 
    WHERE podcasts.id = episodes.podcast_id 
    AND podcasts.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Single User Test:**
   - Log in as User A
   - Create a podcast
   - Verify it appears in the library
   - Delete the podcast
   - Verify it's removed

2. **Multi-User Test:**
   - Log in as User A, create podcasts
   - Sign out
   - Log in as User B
   - Verify User B doesn't see User A's podcasts
   - Create podcasts as User B
   - Sign out, log back in as User A
   - Verify User A only sees their own podcasts

3. **Security Test:**
   - Try to delete a podcast ID that doesn't belong to the current user
   - Should fail silently (no error but nothing deleted)
   - Verify database integrity

## Files Modified
- `feedcast/Services/PodcastService.swift`

## Impact
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - existing functionality maintained
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - no migration needed
- ✅ **Better security** - proper user isolation
- ✅ **Better performance** - smaller query results
