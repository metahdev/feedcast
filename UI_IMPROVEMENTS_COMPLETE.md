# UI/UX Improvements Complete

## Overview

Implemented major UI improvements with podcast detail pages, better AI-generated titles, transcript display, fixed chat interface, and context-aware AI conversations.

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Separate Podcast Detail Page

**New File:** `feedcast/Views/PodcastDetailView.swift`

Features:
- Podcast artwork with gradient
- Title and metadata (episodes count, duration, daily badge)
- About section with description
- Topics/interests as tags
- Episodes list with thumbnails
- Tap episode â†’ goes to PlayerView

**LibraryView Updated:**
- Cards now link to `PodcastDetailView` instead of directly to player
- Better navigation flow: Library â†’ Detail â†’ Player

### 2. âœ… Improved AI-Generated Podcast Titles

**OpenAIService.swift Updates:**

**Better Prompt:**
- Includes today's date for context
- Explicit instructions for compelling titles
- Examples of good titles (3-8 words, specific, engaging)

**Examples:**

- After: "AI Breakthroughs Reshape Medicine"
- After: "SpaceX's Mars Mission Takes Flight"
- After: "Quantum Computing: The Next Frontier"

**Title Extraction:**
- Looks for "TITLE:" prefix in first 3 lines
- Falls back to first line if no prefix
- Smart fallback to "Daily Podcast - [Date]"

### 3. âœ… Player Shows Transcript (Not Episodes)

- Tap any segment â†’ jumps to that time
- Auto-follows along with playback
- Beautiful styled cards

**Removed:**

### 4. âœ… Fixed Chat Field at Bottom

**OpenAI Integration:**
- Uses GPT-4o with podcast context
- Temperature: 0.7 (conversational)

**How It Works:**
1. User asks question
