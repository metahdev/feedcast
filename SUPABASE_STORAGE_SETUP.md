# Supabase Storage Setup for Audio Files

## Overview

Audio files are now uploaded to **Supabase Storage** (cloud storage) instead of being saved locally. This allows:
- ‚úÖ Audio accessible from any device
- ‚úÖ Streaming from cloud URLs
- ‚úÖ No local storage issues
- ‚úÖ Survives app reinstalls
- ‚úÖ Works across multiple devices

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Storage Bucket

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard

2. **Open your project**
   - Select the feedcast project

3. **Go to Storage**
   - Click "Storage" in the left sidebar

4. **Create New Bucket**
   - Click "New bucket" button
   - **Bucket name:** `podcast-audio`
   - **Public bucket:** ‚úÖ **YES** (Check this!)
   - Click "Create bucket"

### 2. Set Bucket Policies

The bucket needs to be publicly readable so audio can stream.

1. **Click on the `podcast-audio` bucket**

2. **Go to Policies tab**

3. **Add Policy for SELECT (Read)**
   - Click "New Policy"
   - Select "Create a custom policy"
   - **Policy name:** `Public read access`
   - **Allowed operation:** SELECT
   - **Policy definition:**
   ```sql
   ((bucket_id = 'podcast-audio'::text) AND (auth.role() = 'anon'::text))
   ```
   - Or simply enable: "Allow public access"

4. **Add Policy for INSERT (Upload)**
   - Click "New Policy"
   - Select "Create a custom policy"  
   - **Policy name:** `Authenticated users can upload`
   - **Allowed operation:** INSERT
   - **Policy definition:**
   ```sql
   ((bucket_id = 'podcast-audio'::text) AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text))
   ```

5. **Add Policy for DELETE**
   - Click "New Policy"
   - **Policy name:** `Users can delete own files`
   - **Allowed operation:** DELETE
   - **Policy definition:**
   ```sql
   ((bucket_id = 'podcast-audio'::text) AND (auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text))
   ```

### 3. Quick Setup (SQL Editor)

Alternatively, run this in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('podcast-audio', 'podcast-audio', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'podcast-audio');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'podcast-audio' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow users to delete their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'podcast-audio' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

## What Happens Now

### During Podcast Generation

1. **GPT generates script** ‚Üí Text content
2. **TTS converts to audio** ‚Üí MP3 data (in chunks if needed)
3. **Upload to Supabase Storage** ‚Üí `podcast-audio/podcasts/[filename].mp3`
4. **Get public URL** ‚Üí `https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/podcast-audio/podcasts/[filename].mp3`
5. **Save URL to database** ‚Üí `episodes.audio_url`

### Console Output

You'll see:
```
‚òÅÔ∏è Uploading audio to Supabase Storage...
üì§ Uploading to: podcasts/abc123_def456.mp3
üìä File size: 1523456 bytes (1.52 MB)
‚úÖ Audio uploaded successfully
üîó Public URL: https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/podcast-audio/podcasts/abc123_def456.mp3
```

## File Structure in Storage

```
podcast-audio/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ podcasts/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [podcastId]_[uuid1].mp3
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [podcastId]_[uuid2].mp3
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [podcastId]_[uuid3].mp3
```

## Benefits

### Before (Local Storage)
‚ùå Files only on device
‚ùå Lost on reinstall
‚ùå Can't access from other devices
‚ùå Local file path in database

### After (Cloud Storage)
‚úÖ Files in cloud
‚úÖ Persistent across reinstalls
‚úÖ Access from any device
‚úÖ Public URL for streaming
‚úÖ Can implement caching later
‚úÖ Can download for offline use

## Testing

After setup:

1. **Clean and rebuild** the app
2. **Generate a podcast**
3. **Check console** for upload logs
4. **Verify in Supabase:**
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí podcast-audio
   - You should see uploaded MP3 files
   - Click a file to get its public URL
   - Paste URL in browser to test playback

## Storage Limits

### Free Tier
- **Storage:** 1 GB
- **Bandwidth:** 2 GB/month
- **File size:** 50 MB max per file

### Typical Podcast Sizes
- 5-minute podcast: ~1-2 MB
- You can store ~500-1000 podcasts in free tier

### If You Exceed Limits
1. Upgrade Supabase plan
2. Implement auto-deletion of old podcasts
3. Compress audio more (use lower bitrate)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Bucket 'podcast-audio' not found"

**Solution:** Create the bucket as described in Step 1 above.

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution:** Make sure policies are set up correctly (Step 2 above).

### Error: "The resource already exists"

**Solution:** File with same name exists. This shouldn't happen with UUID filenames, but you can:
- Delete old file first
- Use a different filename

### Audio won't play in app

**Check:**
1. Is bucket public? (Check bucket settings)
2. Is URL valid? (Paste in browser to test)
3. Is file actually uploaded? (Check Storage in dashboard)
4. Check network connectivity

## Advanced: Custom Storage Backend

If you want to use a different storage provider:

1. Replace `uploadAudioToSupabase()` in `PodcastService.swift`
2. Upload to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.
3. Return the public URL
4. Rest of the code works the same!

## Security Note

Audio files are **publicly accessible** by design (anyone with the URL can stream them). This is normal for podcast audio. If you need private podcasts:

1. Set bucket to private (`public: false`)
2. Generate signed URLs with expiration
3. Update policies for user-specific access
4. Modify `getPublicURL()` to `createSignedUrl()`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Cloud storage setup complete!

Now audio files are properly stored in the cloud and accessible from anywhere! üéâ
