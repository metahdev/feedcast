## Demo Features

Currently working with **dummy data**:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Browse podcasts | ‚úÖ Working | 4 demo podcasts |
| Play controls | ‚úÖ Simulated | Timer-based, not real audio |
| Chat interface | ‚úÖ Working | Rule-based responses |
| Interests CRUD | ‚úÖ Working | In-memory only |
| Search/Filter | ‚úÖ Working | Local filtering |
| Playback state | ‚úÖ Working | Saved locally |

## What's NOT Connected Yet

These require backend integration:

- ‚ùå Real audio playback (needs LiveKit)
- ‚ùå AI podcast generation (needs FetchAI)
- ‚ùå Intelligent chat (needs FetchAI)
- ‚ùå User authentication (needs Supabase)
- ‚ùå Cloud sync (needs Supabase)
- ‚ùå Daily auto-generation

**See [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions.**

## Project Structure

```
feedcast/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/           # Data structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/         # Business logic (dummy data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/       # State management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/            # SwiftUI interfaces
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Edit any Swift file** in Xcode
2. **Build** (`‚åò + B`) to check for errors
3. **Run** (`‚åò + R`) to test

### Adding New Features

1. Create model in `Models/`
2. Add service logic in `Services/`
3. Create ViewModel in `ViewModels/`
4. Build UI in `Views/`

### Debugging

- **Print statements**: Use `print()` for console output
- **Breakpoints**: Click line number gutter in Xcode
- **SwiftUI Previews**: Check `#Preview` at bottom of view files

## Common Issues

### Build Errors

**Error**: Missing files
- **Fix**: Ensure all files are added to target
- Check File Inspector ‚Üí Target Membership

**Error**: Module not found
- **Fix**: Clean build folder (`‚åò + Shift + K`)
- Rebuild (`‚åò + B`)

### Runtime Issues

**App crashes on launch**
- Check Console for error messages
- Ensure iOS deployment target is 17.0+

**UI not updating**
- Check `@Published` properties in ViewModels
- Verify `@StateObject` / `@ObservedObject` usage

**Chat not responding**
- This is expected - responses are simulated
- Check `ChatService.generateDummyResponse()` for logic

## Next Steps

### For Hackathon Demo

1. ‚úÖ App is demo-ready with current features
2. Customize dummy data in services
3. Add your branding/colors
4. Practice the user flow

### For Production

See [INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md):
1. Set up Supabase backend
2. Integrate FetchAI for content
3. Add LiveKit for audio
4. Deploy and test

## Customization

### Change Colors

Edit `Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json`

### Modify Dummy Data

Edit these files:
- `Services/PodcastService.swift` ‚Üí `loadDummyData()`
- `Services/UserService.swift` ‚Üí `loadDummyUser()`
- `Services/ChatService.swift` ‚Üí `loadDummyConversations()`

### Add New Interests

In `Services/UserService.swift`, update `loadDummyUser()`:

```swift
interests: [
    Interest(name: "Your Interest", category: .technology),
    // Add more...
]
```
